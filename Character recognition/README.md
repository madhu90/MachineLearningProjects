The notebook in this folder experiments with the Extended MNIST database:
https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset

This is a dataset of handwritten characters converted to a 28x28 pixel image. There are 6 different sets provided in Binary and CSV formats. There are also 6 different types of splits provided for this dataset and I will be using the Balanced split, downloaded from Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/emnist

It has train and test data for 47 classes. The balanced split has a more uniform distribution of the classes (~2400 images for each class)

To run the notebook, you need to download the dataset from this link and move it to a folder named "data".
